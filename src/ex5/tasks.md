## Task 5.1 - Multiplayer Multithreaded Turn-based Game
> Note: Same as 4.1 but using a Lock

Using the lock synchronisation mechanism with a waiting condition:

- Modify the multithreaded turn-based Chess Game prototype to handle 6 players

## Task 5.2 - Simple Producer-Consumer Pattern
> Note: Same as 4.2 but using Lock

Using the lock and waiting condition(s):

- program a simple producer-consumer pattern
where one thread is producing sequential numbers (incrementing number from zero to 1000),
and another thread is consuming this number by displaying them on the console.
Once finished, the producer should tell the consumer to stop, before exiting the program.
